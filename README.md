## Awesome Scripts for learning OT/ICS protocols
This is a personal project I worked on to get a deeper understanding of how OT protocols work. As a cybersecurity analyst, I'm interested in knowing how they operate in order to detect threats and configure detection rules. If you're in the same situation, I hope this project helps you as much as it helped me. In this repository, I present the scripts and how to use them, along with a brief explanation.

### Protocols Supported
